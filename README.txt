Project Work Distribution:
Part 1
Kevin and Takuya both completed shape classes (using Kevin's)
Part 2
Kevin and Takuya both completed their own fractal drawer class (using kevin's)

Compiling and running:
Any assumptions: User will eventually input Triangle. Rectangle, or Circle in order to go through with the fractial drawing and area calculation.
Additional features:
Known bugs or defects: Sometimes you need to resize the canvas page as in going in full screen to see the whole fractal appear. This was told in the project instructions as a known error that the TA's are aware of and dont contribute to a loss in points. 
Any outside resources used: "Geeks for Geeks" used to look up definitions of classes in java and other syntax for java that we are working on learning such as if else blocks and when to use {}.
Statement:
I certify that the information contained in this README file is complete and accurate.
 I have both read and followed the course policies in the 'Academic Integrity - Course Policy' Section of the course syllabus
